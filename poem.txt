In the quiet of the morning light,
When the world is still and bright,
Dreams awaken, take their flight,
Painting skies with colors bright.

Whispers of the dawn unfold,
Stories new and tales of old,
In each heart, a dream is told,
Courage born, spirits bold.

Mountains tall and rivers wide,
Journeys far, we shall abide,
With the stars as our guide,
Together, weâ€™ll walk side by side.
